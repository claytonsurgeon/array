the array compiler generates a bytecode array
the array executor executes a bytecode array (continuously)

each function is an executable AST node that pushes a respective value onto the stack, each function will perform all possible reductions

variables cascade through the tree structure

each function performs type checking that allows the definitions of strongly typed graphs with type inference

generic numbers Integer and Decimal are coerced into concrete ints like i32, i64, u8, f64, etc

generic integer can be coerced into a float point value, but a generic decimal cannot be coerced into a machine integer value

iz, uz, and fz are register sized numbers\




ref and key


push allows for multi-push

key creates a label for a point
ref looks up the label in the label table

keys 



idx add = Graph(
	key("a", i32(0)),
	key("b", i32(0)),
	key("->", addi32(
		ref("a"),
		ref("b"),
	))
)

idx add = Graph(
	key("->", addi32(
		ref("a"),
		ref("b"),
	))
	key("a", i32(0)),
	key("b", i32(0)),
)

// add: { a + b <- a: b: ![i32] }

contrary to my current design, it might be better for consumers to be specified *before* the value they reference is declared
this allows the push array to be pre-calculated, of course that mean that the operators would have to be typed

push(someIdx, 
	consumer
	consumer
	consumer
)


when a node is updated it display some kind of signal that activates the dependant nodes without have to have a dep list

    


references could be collected then the ref array could be added at the end of the memory space once their dimensions are known
this is ideal, because even though this ruins the locality, it doesn't matter because keys are base expressions anyway
