Error handling

the array compiler generates a bytecode array
the array executor executes a bytecode array (continuously)

each function is an executable AST node that pushes a respective value onto the stack, each function will perform all possible reductions

variables cascade through the tree structure

each function performs type checking that allows the definitions of strongly typed graphs with type inference

generic numbers Integer and Decimal are coerced into concrete ints like i32, i64, u8, f64, etc

generic integer can be coerced into a float point value, but a generic decimal cannot be coerced into a machine integer value

iz, uz, and fz are register sized numbers
